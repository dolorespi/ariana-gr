                <h2>Biography<h2>
                <p>Ariana Grande-Butera is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Her four-octave vocal range has received critical acclaim, and her personal life has been the subject of widespread media attention</p>
				<p>Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical 13. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series Victorious (2010–2013) and Sam & Cat (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album, Yours Truly (2013), topped the US Billboard 200, while its lead single, "The Way", reached the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. Grande's voice and whistle register on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.</p>
				<p>Often regarded as a pop icon and triple threat entertainer, Grande is one of the world's best-selling music artists; she has sold more than 85 million records globally, and all of her studio albums have been certified platinum or higher. Among her Billboard chart records, she is the first artist and only woman to have five number-one debuts, to chart three number one-debuts in one calendar year, to debut the lead singles from each of her studio albums in the top ten, and to have their first five number one singles debut at top spot. Grande is the most streamed female artist ever, the most streamed female artist on Spotify (also 2010s decade) and Apple Music, the most followed female artist on Spotify, and the most subscribed female artist on YouTube. She has been included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019–2020). Grande was named Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019, and the most successful female artist to debut in the 2010s by Billboard. Aside from music, she worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Grande has a large following on social media; she became the most followed woman on Instagram in 2019, and has over 300 million followers as of 2022. She has also ventured into the cosmetics and fashion industries.</p>
